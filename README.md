# obs.edit

Experimental helpers for managing streaming and recording in OBS with the OBS WebSockets plugin. Features include starting and stopping streaming and/or recording, adding markers to important moments during it, and exporting markers as edit decision lists in EDL and FCPXML format.

These tools are aimed towards making the job of editing video files and marking highlights easier, e.g. by importing markers into NLE editing suites.
